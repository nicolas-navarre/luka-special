<h1> The Luka Special: From now on, the Luka Special is when a player has the same amount of points as entire team by halftime. </h1>

This comment has floated around ever since the Mav’s massive Game 7 against the Suns. Since the game, I’ve been searching everywhere in hopes of finding out how often a player has outscored an entire team at the half. The general sentiment was that it couldn’t be all that rare and must happen at least a couple of a times a season, but I could not find anything on the subject. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Since I couldn’t find anything, I went and gathered the halftime box scores of every regular season and playoff game since 1983 (around 50,000 games) myself. Here are all the times a player has outscored an entire team at halftime.

Turns out it’s pretty damn rare. Only 3 games out of the 50,000 or so I checked. And only once has a player actually outscored another team by halftime (shout out to T-Mac). So not common at all, and had never been done in the playoffs before Luka and the Mavs dominant game 7.

***Bonus*** 

What about players who’ve score the same amount of points as an entire team in the second half?

| Kobe Bryant | 55 | 41 | [2006 - Raptors vs Lakers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200601220LAL.html)

| Dirk Nowitzki | 24 | 24 | [2012 - Mavericks vs 76ers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201202170PHI.html)
&nbsp;

Again, only 3 times out of the ~ 50,000 games scanned. The Kobe Special has a pretty good ring to it for second half performances like these but I’ll let the masses decide on that.
